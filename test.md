## Annotated Bibliographies...
Document your search efforts.

Are a collection of *annotations*.

Describe, give publication information, and sometimes evaluate each work in a list of sources.

Are an "internal document".  They exist to aid you and your group in the writing process.

In other words: **You** are the audience.

## Two Types of Annotations
* Descriptive
  * Summarize the contents of the work, without comment or evaluation.
  * Helpful for remembering what a source's main points are.
* Evaluative
  * Offer opinions on each source **as well as describe it**.
  * Helpful for assessing how useful a source will be for your writing.

## Let's look at some examples.

## Overflow Test: Effective Survey Design
* The best survey is one in which the participant knows generally what it is about, but not specifically what the researchers are looking into.
  * That makes the participants less likely to bias their answers because they think you want a certain answer.
* One way to accomplish this is to avoid leading questions.
  * Instead of : Do you agree that mental health support on campus is garbage? [yes, no]
  * Try: How do you feel about NIU’s support of student mental health? [Likert great, okay, meh, not good, bad]
* Conducting human research at NIU is subject to regulations by the IRB (Institutional Review Board).
* Ordinarily, all surveys have to be submitted to the IRB along with 10 pages of forms to be approved before sending the survey out.
* As students, we have an exemption but only under very specific circumstances.
* The survey must be for an assignment in a class.
* The survey results must only be used for the class and cannot be used in any other class nor in other research.
* Last Question: Would you be interested in participating in a Focus Group on this topic? (Optional) Enter your email address if you are interested. [Text box]
* You are required to have 2 separate primary research items.  The survey -> focus group pipeline is recommended, but not obligatory.  Observations are a wonderful alternative.

## Other Interesting Things (That You Probably Don't Need to Remember)
MLA Annotations are written in present tense.

APA Annotations are written in past tense.

Some Annotated Bibliographies include an Introduction section.  For your project you will not need to include this section.
