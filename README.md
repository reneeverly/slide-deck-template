# slide-deck-template
Slide deck template which can be presented via web or converted to PDF/UA.

The font used in the default theme is the wonderful RoadUA by MintType, CC BY-ND.  PDF/UA requires that fonts be embedded in the document, so using a nice freely licensed font makes that a lot easier.

## Todo List
* [x] Sketch out a basic web template with keyboard navigable presentation mode.
	* [x] No JS for challenge mode.
* [ ] Merge web template with the PDF/UA template I used for SPR23.
* [ ] Include instructions for generating the PDF.
	* Note to self: https://github.com/reneeverly/openhtmltopdf-cli is where I fixed the UA flag.
